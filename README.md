## Introduction
It has not been easy for a fresh graduate on his/her first job opportunity and it never got easy for me to adapt the office environment and to apply what I learnt in school. 
I was welcomed to office and my first task was to clean data collected for Ona users survey to a structure that can be used to build reports. 

When data is stored in Ona servers, you can import your data from Ona directly to R using Ona.R package. Read more on Ona.R package in this [blog post](https://blog.ona.io/general/2016/04/15/Ona-R-Integration.html).

With this Ona.R package, I decided to R for my data cleaning and building of charts that I will use on my report.

I used `tidyr` package to help us with functions we wanted for data cleaning. For instance **tidyr** has functions like `Separate()` functions that helps to take multiple columns as input selected and transforms them into key-value pairs.
